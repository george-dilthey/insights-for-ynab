# ynab-gds-connector
Google Data Studio connector for YNAB.

Getting Started:
1. Go to datastudio.google.com to create a new dashboard. When you create a blank dashboard, Google Data Studio (GDS) will prompt you to add a data source. Search for and select the Insights for YNAB connector.

2. In the connector setup screen, you'll need to authorize YNAB. Click "Authorize" and follow the path to login in with your YNAB credentials.

3. Once authorized, you'll need to select the budget you want to connect to and type of data you want to add to your report (Accounts, Transactions, Category Groups, Categories, Payees). Don't worry, you can add more than one data source to a report so you can run through the process again to choose a different data type. Once you've selected the type, click "Connect".

4. The next screen will show you all the fields you're adding to the report. You usually don't need to change anything here and can select "Create Report".
